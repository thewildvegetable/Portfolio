      <h2 class="sectionHead">Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>I am Jeffrey Karger, a fifth year Game Design and Development student at Rochester
                Institute of Technology. I'm also a Software Developer with proficiency in Javascript/ES6/ES7, Websockets, C#, C++, Node.js, HTML, and CSS</p>
            <p>I spend most of my free time exploring the various games in the world, mainly RPG games, and playing in a D&D campaign.
			When I am not working my through an RPG, I am typically practicing competitive Pokemon,
			usually in the Video Game Championship format, or supporting League of Legends.</p>
			<p>When I am not playing games or making games, I am typically practicing and refining
			my martial arts capabilities. Usually, I am practicing Tae-Kwon-Do which I have been
			training in for	over 10 years and received my 3rd degree black belt in back in June 2014.</p>
			<p>The remainder of my time is used to further my understanding of programming and the world
			in general. I have an appetite for knowledge and feeding it is one of my favorite things to do,
			it is part of why I chose to attend RIT.</p>
			<h2 class="sectionHead">Why Am I A Good Fit For Your Company?</h2>
			<p>Are you looking for a knowledgeable worker with amazing work ethic? Are you looking for someone
			who can make almost any meeting time or work time work in his schedule? Do you need a worker who can
			get along with almost anybody? Do you need a worker who will not stop trying to solve a problem until
			he is told not to stop or it proves to be a physical impossibility to achieve?  If your answer to any
			of these questions is yes, it is worth it to you to	consider hiring me, Jeffrey Karger, to your workforce
			so I can help your company on its quest to be the very best, like no company ever was.</p>

                <p>Click of Clans is an online multiplayer strategy game that allows players to pit their castles against each other to try and be the last kingdom standing developed in my Real-Time Interactive Media class in a team with Keegan Taylor and Alexander Woodward.  This project was done over the course of 1 month.</p>
                <p>In Click of Clans, you are battling against up to 3 other players in a simple, click based strategy game.  The object of the game is to build structures in the 3 lanes leading to your castle to help you generate population to use to destroy the opposing castles.  You win the game by being the last castle standing</p>
                <p>During the development of Click of Clans, I was in charge of the Client to Host server relay via websockets.  This involved sending every regular Client's interactions through the main server to the Host so the information could be processed Host-side before sending the information back out to all the Clients in the game.  Additionally, I created the ad-system in the game, making quick jokey ads that the server would send to all users on initial connection.  I also made a skin-purchasing system to allow players to "purchase" skins and equip them using the server to validate skin ownership.  to follow this up, I added the ability to use your equipped skin in game.  Lastly, I wrote in-game client side functionality, such as the ability to click on structures, the draw functionality to put visuals on the screen and the Game State functionality to start and stop the game.</p>

                <p><a href="https://realtimeproject2.herokuapp.com"><img src="/assets/Bump.png" alt="Game Screen" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
                <p>Web Bumper Cars is a project I made in my Real-Time Interactive Media class using websockets created in the span of 3 weeks.  The idea behind the game is that its a game that anyone can join with their friends to play together when they want to.  Everyone controls a circle and uses the arrow keys to move around the screen, bumping into each other and the walls, as they try to gather green squares to earn points.  The game lasts as long as desired and can be a fun short distraction.</p>
                <p>If I were to continue working on this, I would add in server-side score storage to have persistent scores that are sent to new players on join.  Additionally, I would try and tweak the collision formula to try and get a more elastic bounce.</p>

            <div id="projectShowdown" class = "sectionHead">Pokemon Showdown Usage Stats Visualizer</div>
            <section class = "portfolioPiece" id = "portfolioShowdown">
                <p><a href="https://showdownusage.herokuapp.com/"><img src="/assets/Showdown.png" alt="Game Screen" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
                <p>The Pokemon Showdown Usage Stats Visualizer is a project I made in my Rich Media 1 class using the oakdex-pokedex and request.js apis to pull information from Pokemon Showdown's text-file based usage statistics storage system and interpret into visual and usable data created in the span of 3 weeks.  The application functions by pulling the text file for the chosen format from Pokemon Showdown's storage system and interpreting it server-side.  The top 20 most used pokemon from the interpreted data is then sent to the oakdex api to acquire an image of the pokemon and these 20 are then placed onto the screen.  You can then click on a pokemon to see the abilities and moves it can have, as well as click on an ability or move for the details of what it does.</p>
                <p>The biggest difficulty faced during this project was dealing with the inefficient storage method that Pokemon Showdown uses to store its usage information, individual txt files for each format for each month, often with multiple txt files for different areas of the competitive ladder for a single format.  This is to say nothing of the inconsistent updates to the storage with a month's usage info often being added 2+ months after the month changes.  To get around this, I unfortunately had to pick a specific month to get all my usage statistics from and could only use the base, low ladder usage stats files.  The other issue faced during development was that the oakdex-pokedex api could only handle 10 requests from a single source at a time, so I had to recursively request information from it as it sent data back to avoid losing any data and to allow more than 1 user at once.  Additionally, the api couldn't parse different forms for a single pokemon so things like Mega-Charizard-X and Mega Charizard-Y would simply appear as base Charizard.  If I were to go back and improve this project, I would try and figure out a system to determine the most recent month of usage data stored on the Pokemon Showdown site and grab that data.  I would also try to find a different api to handle interpreting the data parsed from the Usage Stats text files.</p>

                <p>Gemsplosion is a multiplayer Hot Seat mobile game that can be played with 3 friends that was developed in Unity for my Casual Games class.  This game was developed in conjunction with Ian Cavanaugh, Rochelle Cohn, James Taggart, and Porter Withers over 5 weeks.</p>
                <p>In Gemsplosion you play as a dwarf hunting gems in a fantasy mine in an attempt to prove you are better at gem hunting than your friends.  You can see the next 3 objects that will be "mined" from the area on your turn and can choose to mine an amount from 1 to 5.  Each gem gives a score from 1 to 3 points, but you can unearth dynamite as you mine, which cuts your score in half.  You have 4 turns to get the highest score and get powerups to help you along on turns 2 and 4.  You can try to take 5, or set things up so a later player is forced to get hit by dynamite.</p>
                <p>On this project, I codeveloped the core game's architecture and powerup functionality.  I created the functionality of the players, the "minable" pick ups (the gems and dynamite), and the power ups.  In addition, I handled the player rotation so the current player was in front to signify who's turn it is.  For powerups, I developed their targeting ability and functionality in addition to visual feedback for both having and using a powerup.  Lastly, I dealt with making the Unity game Android compatible.</p>

                <p>Idle Idol is an Idol themed Idle game that was developed in Unity for my Casual Games class.  This game was developed in conjunction with Ian Cavanaugh, Rochelle Cohn, James Taggart, and Jia Wessen over 5 weeks.</p>
                <p>In Idle Idol, you play as a lazy Pop Star hopeful who wants to enjoy the benefits of being famous without having to do all the work.  To this end, you work to develop ways to make your job easier and easier by clicking to gain currency and purchasing researches to automate the Pop Star process for you.</p>
                <p>During the production of this game, I created the base game loop architecture in addition to the overall Game Manager system.  I also created the behind the scenes functionality for the Upgrades and Researches that players could purchase to help them get currency faster.  In addition, I developed two features that didnt get added due to time constraints. The first feature that didn't make it to the final product was Researches that increased the multiplier gotten per click instead of giving a flat increase to the currency gained per click, allowing for more variety to the Researches available.  The second feature that didn't make it to the final product was a reworking of the automated score increase functionality to allow players to purchase Upgrades that would make the automated score increase occur more frequently.  Unfortunately, the 5 week period for developing this game ended before either of these functionalities could be finished and were not added to the final product.</p>
